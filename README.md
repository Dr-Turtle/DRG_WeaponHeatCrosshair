# Weapon Heat Crosshair

Releases can be found at https://drg.mod.io/weapon-heat-crosshair

Let me know on discord (Dr. Turtle#0001, in the DRG Modding discord) before contributing because I can't be bothered to learn how to merge UE4 binaries

## FSD-Template

Project generated by Archengius' [UE4 Template Generator](https://github.com/Archengius/UE4GameProjectGenerator). Reflected C++ classes generated by CheatingMuppet & Archengius' [UE4SS UHT Generator](https://github.com/UE4SS/UE4SS). If you want to use these tools to generate an FSD project yourself, contact me (Buckminsterfullerene#6666) on Discord for information on how to fix all of the build errors *of which there are plenty*.
